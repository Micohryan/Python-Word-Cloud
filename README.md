# Python-Word-Cloud

I wanted to create a word cloud visualization in Python. Word Cloud allows us to visually see what words frequently show up in a text. The most common application of word clouds in business is usually customer feedback. I decided to go on Kaggle to find a customer survey dataset that I could use to create a wordcloud Visualization. I found this Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arushchillar/disneyland-reviews that had customer reviews of three disneyland branches. I created a Python script to clean the data and to create a word cloud visualization.
